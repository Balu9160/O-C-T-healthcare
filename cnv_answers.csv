"Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) is a condition where abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, often leaking fluid or blood, causing vision loss. 
"
"CNV occurs when the retina is damaged, causing the body to grow abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid and blood, damaging the macula. 
"
"CNV can cause blurry vision, distorted central vision, and dark spots in your field of view. 
"
"There are two main types: Classic CNV, which appears bright and well-defined on imaging, and Occult CNV, which is less defined and hazy. 
"
"Classic CNV is more defined and aggressive, often causing rapid vision loss. Occult CNV is less defined and progresses slower, with less vision loss.

"Anti-VEGF injections are typically well-tolerated, with most patients experiencing minimal discomfort.  
"
"Anti-VEGF injections are typically given every 4-8 weeks, but the frequency can vary based on your individual response to treatment.

"Surgery is rarely the first option for CNV, but it may be considered for severe cases with extensive leakage or retinal detachment. 
"
"CNV is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam, OCT imaging to visualize retinal layers, and angiography to highlight leaking blood vessels. 
"
"CNV can cause blurry or distorted central vision, dark spots in your field of vision, and difficulty seeing fine details. 
"
""
"Yes, a family history of macular diseases like AMD increases your risk for CNV. 
"
"Yes, smoking significantly increases your risk of developing CNV, especially if you have age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 
"
"You can use an Amsler grid to check for any distortions or blind spots in your central vision. 
"
"Quit smoking, maintain a healthy diet rich in antioxidants, manage blood pressure, and wear UV-blocking sunglasses. 
"
"While there's no specific food to avoid, a balanced diet rich in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, and berries is beneficial for overall eye health. 
"
"CNV is not typically cured, but treatments can slow or stop its progression, preventing further vision loss. 
"
"A diet rich in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, berries, and citrus fruits can help support retinal health and reduce oxidative stress. 
"
"Follow-up exams are recommended every 4-6 weeks, especially during treatment. 
"
"Low vision aids are tools that help people with vision loss perform daily tasks. They include magnifiers, reading aids, and special lighting. 
"
"Support groups offer emotional support, coping strategies, and practical advice from others facing similar vision challenges. They can help you adjust to potential vision loss and connect with resources.

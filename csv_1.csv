0,What is Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)?,"Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) is a condition where abnormal blood vessels form beneath the retina, potentially leading to severe vision impairment.","Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) is a condition where abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, often leaking fluid or blood, causing vision loss. 
"
1,What causes CNV?,"CNV is often caused by conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), high myopia, inflammation, or eye trauma.","CNV occurs when the retina is damaged, causing the body to grow abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid and blood, damaging the macula. 
"
2,How does CNV affect my vision?,"CNV can lead to fluid leakage or bleeding into the retina, causing macular degeneration and vision loss.","CNV can cause blurry vision, distorted central vision, and dark spots in your field of view. 
"
3,What are the main types of CNV?,"The main types are Classic CNV, Occult CNV, Type 1 (sub-retinal pigment epithelium), and Type 2 (sub-retinal).","There are two main types: Classic CNV, which appears bright and well-defined on imaging, and Occult CNV, which is less defined and hazy. 
"
4,What is the difference between Classic and Occult CNV?,"Classic CNV appears well-defined and is more aggressive, while Occult CNV is less defined and progresses more slowly.","Classic CNV is more defined and aggressive, often causing rapid vision loss. Occult CNV is less defined and progresses slower, with less vision loss. 
"
5,What is Anti-VEGF treatment?,"Anti-VEGF injections reduce abnormal blood vessel growth, helping to control CNV progression.",
6,Are Anti-VEGF injections painful?,"Patients may experience mild discomfort, but the procedure is typically quick and done under local anesthesia.","Anti-VEGF injections are typically well-tolerated, with most patients experiencing minimal discomfort.  
"
7,How often will I need Anti-VEGF injections?,"Usually every 4-8 weeks, depending on the condition's severity and response to treatment.","Anti-VEGF injections are typically given every 4-8 weeks, but the frequency can vary based on your individual response to treatment. 
"
8,What risks are associated with Anti-VEGF injections?,"Possible side effects include eye redness, discomfort, and, rarely, infection or increased eye pressure.",
9,What is Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)?,"PDT uses a photosensitizing drug and laser to target abnormal blood vessels, helping reduce fluid leakage.",
10,Is laser treatment an option for CNV?,"Yes, laser photocoagulation is sometimes used, though it's typically reserved for specific cases due to risks.",
11,Can surgery treat CNV?,Surgery is rarely the first option and is generally only considered for severe cases with extensive leakage or retinal detachment.,"Surgery is rarely the first option for CNV, but it may be considered for severe cases with extensive leakage or retinal detachment. 
"
12,How is CNV diagnosed?,"CNV is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam, OCT imaging, and sometimes angiography tests like fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography.","CNV is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam, OCT imaging to visualize retinal layers, and angiography to highlight leaking blood vessels. 
"
13,What are the signs of CNV?,"Signs include blurry or distorted vision, seeing dark spots, and sometimes sudden vision loss.","CNV can cause blurry or distorted central vision, dark spots in your field of vision, and difficulty seeing fine details. 
"
14,Am I at risk for CNV if I have high myopia?,"Yes, high myopia increases the risk of CNV due to the elongated eye shape, which can strain the retina.",
15,Does my family history affect my CNV risk?,"Yes, a family history of macular conditions like AMD can increase the risk of developing CNV.","Yes, a family history of macular diseases like AMD increases your risk for CNV. 
"
16,Can smoking increase my risk of CNV?,"Yes, smoking accelerates retinal aging and increases the risk of AMD-related CNV.","Yes, smoking significantly increases your risk of developing CNV, especially if you have age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 
"
17,How can I monitor my symptoms at home?,"An Amsler grid can help detect any visual distortions, allowing you to monitor changes in your vision.","You can use an Amsler grid to check for any distortions or blind spots in your central vision. 
"
18,What lifestyle changes can help manage CNV?,"Eating an antioxidant-rich diet, controlling blood pressure, quitting smoking, and wearing UV protection can help.","Quit smoking, maintain a healthy diet rich in antioxidants, manage blood pressure, and wear UV-blocking sunglasses. 
"
19,Should I avoid any specific foods?,It's recommended to limit processed foods and sugars as they can impact blood glucose control and eye health.,"While there's no specific food to avoid, a balanced diet rich in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, and berries is beneficial for overall eye health. 
"
20,Can CNV be cured?,"While CNV can’t be cured, treatments like Anti-VEGF injections and PDT can help manage and slow its progression.","CNV is not typically cured, but treatments can slow or stop its progression, preventing further vision loss. 
"
21,What are the dietary recommendations for CNV?,"A diet high in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin C-rich foods is beneficial for eye health.","A diet rich in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, berries, and citrus fruits can help support retinal health and reduce oxidative stress. 
"
22,How often should I have follow-up exams?,"Typically every 4-6 weeks during treatment, depending on your doctor’s recommendation and your condition's progression.","Follow-up exams are recommended every 4-6 weeks, especially during treatment. 
"
23,What are low vision aids?,Low vision aids include tools like magnifiers and special lighting that help manage vision impairment in daily tasks.,"Low vision aids are tools that help people with vision loss perform daily tasks. They include magnifiers, reading aids, and special lighting. 
"
24,How can support groups help if I have CNV?,"Support groups offer mental support, resources, and coping strategies for managing potential vision loss.","Support groups offer emotional support, coping strategies, and practical advice from others facing similar vision challenges. They can help you adjust to potential vision loss and connect with resources.
